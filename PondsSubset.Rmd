#I want to look at emergence just based on certain ponds (ignoring ponds which have no nemo)

#in 2023 ponds 5,9, and 12 had nemo. Lets start with 12 as it had the most in 2022

```{r}
#take the dataset of just nemo and pull out a pond (in this case, pond 12)
Pond12Nemo <- subset(NemoDW, grepl("12", Pond))
```

```{r}
#Pond 12 samples of all other 
Pond12Other <- subset(NoNemoDry, grepl("12", Pond))
```

```{r}
#find the sum of dry weight per date (Nemo) 
Pond12NemoDate <- aggregate(Pond12Nemo$SampleDW ~ Pond12Nemo$Date, data = Pond12Nemo, FUN= sum)
```

```{r}
#find the sum of dry weight per date (all other)
Pond12OtherDate <- aggregate(Pond12Other$SampleDW ~ Pond12Other$Date, data = Pond12Other, FUN= sum)
```
